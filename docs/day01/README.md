# 🏔️ Day 1: Basic Programming Magic in R

*Welcome to the Magic Forest where variables come alive and loops create endless possibilities!*

## 🔮 Learning Journey Overview

Today we'll embark on our first adventure into the magical world of R programming! By the end of today, you'll be casting spells with code and creating your very own digital art.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- 🔤 Write your first lines of R code
- 📝 Understand comments and why they're important
- 🎲 Master variables and data types
- 📦 Explore packages and open-source magic
- 🔄 Control program flow with if-else and loops
- 🎨 Create beautiful mosaic art with code

## 📚 Today's Magical Concepts

#### 9. 🎮 Class Challenge: Word Reorganizer
*Team up to create and solve word puzzles*

#### 10. 🎨 Individual Project: Mosaic Art
*Create beautiful art using programming*

## 🎪 Activities & Challenges

### 🏝️ Activity 1: Data Type Island
*Duration: 20 minutes*

Explore an imaginary island where different data types live in different regions. You'll categorize R objects and learn how R "thinks" about different kinds of information.

**What you'll learn:**
- Numbers (integers and decimals)
- Text (characters and strings)
- True/False values (logical)
- Lists and vectors

**Files:** `activities/data-type-island.R`

### 🔄 Activity 2: Loop Adventures
*Duration: 25 minutes*

Practice writing for loops through three magical examples that demonstrate the power of repetition in programming.

**What you'll learn:**
- Basic for loop syntax
- Using print() statements
- Debugging incomplete code
- Problem-solving strategies

**Files:** `activities/loop-adventures.R`

### 🎯 Class Challenge: Magic Forest Word Reorganizer
*Duration: 30 minutes*

**Part 1:** Given a magical story sentence, use a for loop to reorganize the words and create a word list.

**Part 2:** Challenge a classmate to write code that restores your scrambled words back into the original story!

**Example Story:**
*"In the Magic Forest, a smart rabbit and a tiny dragon became friends, built a flying boat out of leaves, and sailed through the sky to save a sleepy bear cub who was stuck on a candy cloud."*

**Files:** `activities/magic-forest-challenge.R`

### 🎨 Individual Project: Mosaic Art Creator
*Duration: 45 minutes*

Create stunning digital mosaic art using R programming! You'll use loops, variables, and creativity to generate colorful patterns.

**What you'll create:**
- Geometric patterns
- Color gradients
- Repeating designs
- Your own artistic vision

**Files:** `activities/mosaic-art-project.R`

## 📊 Sample Code Preview

Here's a sneak peek at some magic you'll learn today:

```r
# 🔮 Creating magical variables
wizard_name <- "Hermione"
spell_power <- 95
is_magical <- TRUE

# 🌟 A simple for loop
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(paste("Casting spell number", i))
}

# 🎨 The beginning of art creation
colors <- c("red", "blue", "green", "purple")
plot(1:10, 1:10, col = colors, pch = 19, cex = 3)
```

## 🎒 Materials Needed

### For Students:
- 💻 Laptop with internet connection
- 🔗 Posit Cloud account (set up in advance)
- 🤖 Claude AI account (optional but recommended)
- ✏️ Notebook and pencil for planning

### For Instructor:
- 📊 Projector for code demonstrations
- 🧸 Physical props for data type explanations
- 📋 Printed backup activities (in case of tech issues)
- ⏰ Timer for activities

## 🎯 Success Indicators

By the end of Day 1, students should be able to:

- ✅ Write and run basic R code in Posit Cloud
- ✅ Explain what variables are and create their own
- ✅ Identify different data types in R
- ✅ Write a simple for loop
- ✅ Use if-else statements for basic decisions
- ✅ Create a colorful plot or pattern
- ✅ Help a classmate debug simple code issues
- ✅ Feel excited about tomorrow's data adventures!

## 🌟 Homework & Extensions

### 🎯 Required Reflection (10 minutes):
Write 3 sentences about:
1. What was your favorite part of today?
2. What was the most challenging concept?
3. What are you excited to learn tomorrow?

### ✨ Optional Extensions:
- Modify your mosaic art with different colors or patterns
- Create a for loop that counts down from 10 to 1
- Think of three things in your daily life that involve "data"
- Explore additional plot types in R (with parent/guardian)
