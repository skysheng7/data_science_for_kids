# 🔮 Day 1 - Spell 6: Age Group Sorter (Like the Physical Activity!)

# 🎂 Oda's age group magic (just like our shirt color game!)
age <- 4

if (age < 6) {
  print("🐣 Little explorer - just starting the adventure!")
} else if (age >= 6 & age <= 9) {
  print("🧸 Young adventurer - ready for fun!")
} else if (age >= 10 & age <= 14) {
  print("🧙‍♀️ Data wizard in training - that's you!")
} else if (age >= 15 & age <= 18) {
  print("🚀 Teen tech master - almost ready to rule the world!")
} else {
  print("🎓 Wise adult - teaching the next generation!")
}

# 🎈 Activity: Age Detective Challenge!
# 1. Try your real age and see what message you get!
# 2. Try ages: 5, 8, 12, 16, 25
# 3. Family Fun: Try your family members' ages!

# ✨ Test different ages:
# age <- 5    # What category?
# age <- 8    # Young adventurer?
# age <- 12   # Data wizard in training?
# age <- 16   # Teen tech master?
# age <- 25   # Wise adult?

# 🤔 Think about these questions:
# - What happens if someone is exactly 6 years old?
# - What happens if someone is exactly 14 years old?
# - Why do we use >= and <= instead of just > and <?
# - What age ranges do your family members fall into?

# 🎯 Challenge: Create your own age-based activity sorter!
# What activities would be good for each age group?
