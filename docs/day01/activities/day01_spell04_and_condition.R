# 🔮 Day 1 - Spell 4: AND Condition Magic (Both Things Must Be True!)
# 🎭 Oda's perfect day detector
temperature <- 25
weather <- "sunny"

if (temperature > 20 & weather == "sunny") {
  print("🏖️ Perfect day for swimming and playing!")
  print("🦦 Oda is super happy!")
} else {
  print("🏠 Maybe it's a good day to stay inside and code!")
}

# 🎈 Activity: Weather Wizard!
# 1. Try these combinations and see what Oda does:
#    - temperature <- 15 and weather <- "sunny"
#    - temperature <- 25 and weather <- "rainy"  
#    - temperature <- 30 and weather <- "sunny"

# ✨ Test different weather combinations:
# temperature <- 15
# weather <- "sunny"    # Warm enough? Sunny enough?

# temperature <- 25
# weather <- "rainy"    # Both conditions met?

# temperature <- 30
# weather <- "sunny"    # Perfect day?

# 🤔 Challenge Questions:
# - What happens when ONLY temperature is good but weather is bad?
# - What happens when ONLY weather is good but temperature is bad?
# - Why do we need BOTH to be true for a perfect day?

# 🎯 Experiment: Try creating your own perfect day conditions!
# Maybe add wind speed or humidity?
