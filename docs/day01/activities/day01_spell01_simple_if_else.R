# 🔮 Day 1 - Spell 1: Simple If-Else Magic

my_favorite_number <- 7

if (my_favorite_number > 5) {
  print("🎉 Wow! That's a big number!")
} else {
  print("💭 That's a nice small number!")
}

# 🎈 Activity: Try It Yourself!
# 1. Change `my_favorite_number` to different values (try 3, 10, 1)
# 2. Run the code each time - what happens?
# 3. **Challenge:** Can you predict the message before running it?

# ✨ Try these values and predict the output:
# my_favorite_number <- 3   # What message will this show?
# my_favorite_number <- 10  # What about this one?
# my_favorite_number <- 1   # And this one?

# 💡 Remember: Only change ONE value at a time to see the magic happen!
