# 🔮 Day 1 - Spell 8: No Else Challenge (Sometimes Nothing Happens!)

# 🏆 Oda's achievement unlocked detector
points <- 85

if (points >= 100) {
  print("🏆 LEGENDARY! You're a coding master!")
}

if (points >= 75) {
  print("⭐ AWESOME! You're doing great!")
}

if (points >= 50) {
  print("👍 GOOD JOB! Keep practicing!")
}

# Notice: No "else" - you might get multiple messages!
print(paste("🎯 You have", points, "points total!"))

# 🎈 Activity: Achievement Hunter!
# 1. Try these point values: 30, 60, 80, 120
# 2. **Question:** Why might someone get multiple achievement messages?
# 3. **Challenge:** What's the minimum points to get all three achievements?

# ✨ Test different point values:
# points <- 30   # How many achievements?
# points <- 60   # How many now?
# points <- 80   # Multiple achievements?
# points <- 120  # All achievements?

# 🤔 Think about these questions:
# - Why do we get multiple messages for high scores?
# - How is this different from if-else-if chains?
# - What's the minimum points needed for each achievement level?
# - What happens if you have 49 points?
