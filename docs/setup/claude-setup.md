## 🎯 How to Ask Claude for Help

### 🔮 Magic Phrases for Young Coders

**For Understanding Code:**
- "Can you explain this R code like I'm 10 years old?"
- "What does this function do in simple terms?"
- "Why isn't my code working?"

**For Getting Help:**
- "I'm trying to make a graph in R but I'm stuck"
- "How do I fix this error message?"
- "Can you help me write code to [specific task]?"

**For Learning New Things:**
- "What's a fun way to practice R loops?"
- "Can you show me how to make colorful graphs?"
- "What are some cool things I can do with data?"

### 📝 Example Conversation

**You:** "Hi Claude! I have this R code but I get an error. Can you help?

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(X)
```

**Claude:** "I see the issue! You created a variable called `x` (lowercase), but you're trying to use `X` (uppercase). R is case-sensitive, so it thinks these are different variables. Try changing the last line to:

```r
mean(x)
```

This should work perfectly!"

## 🛡️ Safety Guidelines

### 🚦 Green Light (Always OK)
- ✅ Ask for help with R code
- ✅ Request explanations of programming concepts
- ✅ Get suggestions for fun coding projects
- ✅ Ask about data science careers

### 🟡 Yellow Light (Check with Instructor)
- ⚠️ Asking for homework answers (learn, don't copy!)
- ⚠️ Requesting personal information about others
- ⚠️ Discussing topics unrelated to coding

### 🔴 Red Light (Never Do)
- ❌ Share personal information (address, phone, etc.)
- ❌ Ask Claude to do all your work for you
- ❌ Use Claude for non-educational purposes during camp

## 💡 Pro Tips for Young Programmers

1. **🎯 Be specific**: Instead of "my code is broken," explain what you were trying to do
2. **📋 Share your code**: Copy and paste your R code so Claude can see the exact problem
3. **🤔 Ask "why"**: Don't just ask for fixes - ask Claude to explain why something works
4. **🎮 Make it fun**: Ask Claude to suggest creative coding challenges
5. **👥 Collaborate**: Share cool Claude tips with your camp friends!

## 🔄 Using Claude with Posit Cloud

Perfect workflow for our camp:

1. 💻 Write code in Posit Cloud

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I can't create an account"**
- Ask a parent/guardian to help with email verification
- Make sure you're using a valid email address

**"Claude isn't understanding my question"**
- Try being more specific about your problem
- Include your actual R code in your question
- Ask your instructor for help phrasing the question

**"Claude gave me code that doesn't work"**
- Double-check you copied the code exactly
- AI isn't perfect - it's learning too!
- Ask your instructor to help debug
