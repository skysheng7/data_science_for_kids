## 📚 Load Our Magical Libraries

First, let's load the libraries we need for our machine learning magic!

```{r load-libraries}
# Load our magical libraries
library(tidymodels)  # For machine learning magic
library(tidyverse)   # For data manipulation and visualization
```

## 📖 Load the Magical Creature Dataset

Oda has been collecting data about various magical creatures she's encountered. Let's see what she's discovered!

```{r load-data}
# Load the magical creature dataset
# This dataset contains information about various magical creatures Oda has encountered
creatures <- read_csv("../datasets/magical_creatures.csv")

# Take a look at our magical friends
head(creatures)
```

## 🔍 Part 1: Exploring the Magical Creature Data

Let's get to know our magical creatures better!

```{r explore-data}
# Let's see what variables we have to work with
# Each creature has: size, magic_power, friendliness_score, and behavior (friendly/mischievous)
glimpse(creatures)
```

```{r count-behaviors}
# How many creatures of each type do we have?
creatures %>%
  count(behavior)
```

### 🎨 Visualizing Our Creatures

Let's create a beautiful plot to see if we can spot any patterns!

```{r plot-creatures}
# Let's visualize our creatures!
# Plot size vs magic_power, colored by behavior
ggplot(creatures, aes(x = size, y = magic_power, color = behavior)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Oda's Magical Creature Collection",
       x = "Size", 
       y = "Magic Power",
       color = "Behavior") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 🤔 Think About It!

💡 **Question:** Can you see any patterns? Do friendly creatures tend to cluster together?

## ⚙️ Part 2: Setting Up Our KNN Model

Now let's prepare our data for machine learning magic!

### 📊 Split the Data

We need to split our data so we can train our model and then test how well it works on "new" creatures.

```{r split-data}
# Split our data into training and testing sets
# We'll use 75% for training, 25% for testing
set.seed(123)  # For reproducible results

creature_split <- initial_split(creatures, prop = 0.75, strata = behavior)
creature_train <- training(creature_split)
creature_test <- testing(creature_split)
```

```{r check-split}
# Let's check our split worked well
cat("Training data:\n")
creature_train %>% count(behavior)

cat("\nTesting data:\n")
creature_test %>% count(behavior)
```

### 🍳 Create a Recipe for Data Preprocessing

In machine learning, we often need to "cook" our data before feeding it to the model. Here's our recipe!

```{r create-recipe}
# Create a recipe for preprocessing our data
# We'll standardize size and magic_power to make sure they're on the same scale
creature_recipe <- recipe(behavior ~ size + magic_power, data = creature_train) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors()) %>%     # Scale to standard deviation 1
  step_center(all_predictors())        # Center around 0

print("Our magical recipe is ready!")
```

### 🤖 Create Our KNN Model

Now let's create our KNN model. We'll start with K=5 neighbors.

```{r create-model}
# Create our KNN model specification
# We'll start with K=5 neighbors
knn_model <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 5) %>%
  set_engine("kknn") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

print("KNN model created with K=5 neighbors!")
```

---

## 🎓 Part 3: Training Our KNN Classifier

Time to train our magical creature classifier!

```{r create-workflow}
# Create a workflow that combines our recipe and model
creature_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(creature_recipe) %>%
  add_model(knn_model)

print("Workflow assembled - ready for training!")
```

```{r train-model}
# Train our model!
creature_fit <- creature_workflow %>%
  fit(data = creature_train)

print("🎉 Model training complete!")
```

```{r make-predictions}
# Let's make predictions on our test data
creature_predictions <- predict(creature_fit, creature_test) %>%
  bind_cols(creature_test)

# Look at our predictions
head(creature_predictions)
```

---

## 📈 Part 4: Evaluating Our Magical Predictions

How well did our model do? Let's find out!

### 🎯 Calculate Accuracy

```{r calculate-accuracy}
# Calculate the accuracy of our predictions
accuracy_result <- creature_predictions %>%
  metrics(truth = behavior, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  filter(.metric == "accuracy")

print(paste("Our KNN model accuracy:", round(accuracy_result$.estimate, 3)))
```

### 📊 Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix shows us exactly where our model made mistakes.

```{r confusion-matrix}
# Create a confusion matrix to see where we made mistakes
creature_predictions %>%
  conf_mat(truth = behavior, estimate = .pred_class)
```

### 🎨 Visualize Predictions vs Reality

```{r plot-predictions}
# Visualize our predictions vs actual behavior
ggplot(creature_predictions, aes(x = size, y = magic_power)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = behavior, shape = .pred_class), size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Actual vs Predicted Creature Behavior",
       subtitle = "Color = Actual, Shape = Predicted",
       x = "Size", 
       y = "Magic Power",
       color = "Actual Behavior",
       shape = "Predicted Behavior") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## 🔧 Part 5: Testing Different K Values

Different K values can give us different results. Let's find the best one!

```{r test-k-function}
# Let's try different K values to see which works best!
test_k_values <- function(k_val) {
  knn_model_k <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = k_val) %>%
    set_engine("kknn") %>%
    set_mode("classification")
  
  workflow_k <- workflow() %>%
    add_recipe(creature_recipe) %>%
    add_model(knn_model_k)
  
  fit_k <- workflow_k %>% fit(data = creature_train)
  
  predictions_k <- predict(fit_k, creature_test) %>%
    bind_cols(creature_test)
  
  accuracy_k <- predictions_k %>%
    metrics(truth = behavior, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
    filter(.metric == "accuracy") %>%
    pull(.estimate)
  
  return(accuracy_k)
}
```

```{r test-different-k}
# Test different K values
k_values <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 10)
accuracies <- map_dbl(k_values, test_k_values)

# Create a data frame with results
k_results <- tibble(K = k_values, Accuracy = accuracies)

print("Results for different K values:")
print(k_results)
```

```{r plot-k-results}
# Plot K vs Accuracy
ggplot(k_results, aes(x = K, y = Accuracy)) +
  geom_line(color = "orange", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "#73bbda", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "KNN Performance: How K Affects Accuracy",
       x = "Number of Neighbors (K)",
       y = "Accuracy") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## 🔮 Part 6: Predict New Magical Creatures!

Oda has discovered some new creatures! Can you predict their behavior?

```{r new-creatures}
# Oda has discovered some new creatures! Can you predict their behavior?
new_creatures <- tibble(
  name = c("Sparkle Dragon", "Tiny Pixie", "Giant Troll"),
  size = c(8.5, 1.2, 9.8),
  magic_power = c(9.1, 7.8, 3.2)
)

print("New creatures discovered:")
print(new_creatures)
```

```{r predict-new}
# Make predictions for the new creatures
# Use the best K value from your analysis above
best_k <- k_results %>%
  filter(Accuracy == max(Accuracy)) %>%
  pull(K) %>%
  first()

print(paste("Best K value:", best_k))

# Retrain model with best K
best_knn_model <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = best_k) %>%
  set_engine("kknn") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

best_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(creature_recipe) %>%
  add_model(best_knn_model)

best_fit <- best_workflow %>% fit(data = creature_train)

# Predict behavior for new creatures
new_predictions <- predict(best_fit, new_creatures) %>%
  bind_cols(new_creatures)

print("Predictions for new magical creatures:")
print(new_predictions)
```

## 🎈 Your Turn: Challenges!

### ✨ Challenge 1: Add friendliness_score as a third predictor
**Hint:** Modify the recipe to include all three variables

```{r challenge1, eval=FALSE}
# Your code here:
# creature_recipe_3vars <- recipe(behavior ~ size + magic_power + friendliness_score, data = creature_train) %>%
#   step_scale(all_predictors()) %>%
#   step_center(all_predictors())
```

### ✨ Challenge 2: Try to get accuracy above 85%
**Hint:** Experiment with different combinations of predictors and K values

```{r challenge2, eval=FALSE}
# Your code here:
# Try different combinations and K values!
```

### ✨ Challenge 3: Create a beautiful visualization showing the decision boundaries
**Hint:** Make predictions on a grid of points and color the background

```{r challenge3, eval=FALSE}
# Your code here:
# Create a grid of points, make predictions, and visualize!
```

## 💡 Key Learning Points

🎯 **What we learned today:**

- **KNN makes predictions based on the K closest neighbors** - like asking your K nearest friends for advice!
- **The choice of K affects how flexible vs stable our predictions are** - too small and it's noisy, too big and it's too simple
- **Standardizing features is important when they have different scales** - we want all features to have equal influence
- **Always test on data the model hasn't seen before!** - this tells us how well it will work in the real world

🔮 **Remember:** Machine learning is like teaching a computer to recognize patterns, just like how you learned to recognize different types of magical creatures!
