# 🔮 Day 4 - Spell 4: Bootstrap Bootcamp Relay Race

## 🔄 The Ultimate Time Machine Challenge

Welcome to the most mind-bending statistical adventure ever! You'll discover the magical power of bootstrapping through an epic relay race.

### 🕐 Understanding Bootstrap Time Travel

**The Concept:**
Imagine you have only ONE bag of candies, but you want to know what would happen if you had MANY similar bags. Bootstrapping is like a time machine - you can simulate having many samples from just one!

**The Magic Rule:** Sample WITH replacement (always put the candy back!)

### 🏃‍♀️ Relay Race Setup

**Your Team's Bag:** Each team gets one bag with exactly the same candies as your original Random Grab sample.

**Station Layout:**
- **Station 1:** Sample Grabber (grab 1 candy, look at color)
- **Station 2:** Color Recorder (write it down on the data sheet)  
- **Station 3:** Replacer (put candy back in bag, shake bag)
- **Station 4:** Counter (update the running totals)

### 🏆 Physical Relay Challenge

**Relay Rules:**
1. Teams line up at Station 1
2. Each team member completes one full rotation through all 4 stations
3. **CRITICAL RULE:** Always put the candy back and shake the bag!
4. Goal: Complete 20 bootstrap samples as fast as possible
5. Record results accurately while racing

**Data Collection Sheet:**
```

### 📊 Digital Bootstrap Analysis

```{r}
# 🔄 Enter your bootstrap relay results here

# Your original sample (from previous activity)
original_red <- ...
original_blue <- ...
original_green <- ...
original_yellow <- ...
original_orange <- ...

original_sample <- c(original_red, original_blue, original_green, 
                    original_yellow, original_orange)

# Your bootstrap totals from the relay race
bootstrap_red <- ...     # How many red you drew in 20 samples
bootstrap_blue <- ...    # How many blue you drew in 20 samples
bootstrap_green <- ...   # How many green you drew in 20 samples
bootstrap_yellow <- ...  # How many yellow you drew in 20 samples
bootstrap_orange <- ...  # How many orange you drew in 20 samples

bootstrap_totals <- c(bootstrap_red, bootstrap_blue, bootstrap_green,
                     bootstrap_yellow, bootstrap_orange)

color_names <- c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Orange")

print("🔄 Bootstrap Relay Results:")
print("Original Sample vs Bootstrap Totals:")
for(i in 1:length(color_names)) {
  cat(color_names[i], "- Original:", original_sample[i], 
      ", Bootstrap:", bootstrap_totals[i], "\n")
}
```

### 🎯 Bootstrap Magic Calculation

```{r}
# Calculate bootstrap proportions
bootstrap_proportions <- bootstrap_totals / 20  # 20 total bootstrap samples
original_proportions <- original_sample / 10    # 10 candies in original

print("🎯 Proportion Comparison:")
for(i in 1:length(color_names)) {
  cat(color_names[i], "- Original:", round(original_proportions[i], 2),
      ", Bootstrap:", round(bootstrap_proportions[i], 2), "\n")
}

# Calculate the difference
differences <- abs(bootstrap_proportions - original_proportions)
average_difference <- mean(differences)

print(paste("🔍 Average difference:", round(average_difference, 3)))

if(average_difference < 0.1) {
  print("🎯 AMAZING! Your bootstrap closely matched your original!")
} else if(average_difference < 0.2) {
  print("👍 Good! Bootstrap gave similar results to original!")
} else {
  print("🎲 Interesting! Bootstrap sampling showed some variability!")
}
```

### 🔮 Simulating Many Bootstrap Samples

```{r}
# 🔮 R Magic: Let's do 1000 bootstrap samples instantly!

# Create a vector representing your original sample
original_colors <- c(rep("Red", original_red),
                    rep("Blue", original_blue),
                    rep("Green", original_green),
                    rep("Yellow", original_yellow),
                    rep("Orange", original_orange))

# Function to do one bootstrap sample
bootstrap_sample <- function() {
  sample(original_colors, 10, replace = TRUE)
}

# Do 1000 bootstrap samples
num_bootstraps <- 1000
bootstrap_means <- numeric(num_bootstraps)

for(i in 1:num_bootstraps) {
  boot_sample <- bootstrap_sample()
  # Calculate proportion of red candies in this bootstrap
  bootstrap_means[i] <- sum(boot_sample == "Red") / 10
}

# Show the distribution
hist(bootstrap_means, 
     breaks = 20,
     main = "🔮 1000 Bootstrap Samples - Red Proportion",
     xlab = "Proportion of Red Candies",
     col = "lightcoral")

# Add your original proportion
original_red_prop <- original_red / 10
abline(v = original_red_prop, col = "red", lwd = 3, lty = 2)
text(original_red_prop, max(hist(bootstrap_means, plot = FALSE)$counts) * 0.8, 
     paste("Original:", round(original_red_prop, 2)), pos = 4)

print(paste("🔮 Bootstrap mean of red proportion:", round(mean(bootstrap_means), 3)))
print(paste("🎯 Original red proportion:", round(original_red_prop, 3)))
```

### 🏆 Team Championship Results

```{r}
# 🏆 Calculate team performance metrics

# Speed score (if you tracked time)
# team_time <- ...  # Enter your relay time in minutes

# Accuracy score
accuracy_score <- 1 - average_difference  # Higher is better
accuracy_score <- max(0, accuracy_score)  # Can't be negative

print("🏆 TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP RESULTS:")
print("============================")
print(paste("🎯 Accuracy Score:", round(accuracy_score, 3), "out of 1.0"))
# print(paste("⚡ Speed Score:", team_time, "minutes"))
print(paste("🔄 Bootstrap Samples Completed: 20"))

# Championship level
if(accuracy_score > 0.8) {
  print("🥇 GOLD MEDAL: Bootstrap Wizard Level!")
} else if(accuracy_score > 0.6) {
  print("🥈 SILVER MEDAL: Bootstrap Apprentice Level!")
} else {
  print("🥉 BRONZE MEDAL: Bootstrap Beginner Level!")
}
```

### 🤯 Mind-Blowing Bootstrap Discovery

```{r}
# Compare your physical bootstrap to computer bootstrap
physical_red_prop <- bootstrap_red / 20
computer_red_prop <- mean(bootstrap_means)

print("🤯 MIND-BLOWING COMPARISON:")
print("==========================")
print(paste("Your physical bootstrap (20 samples):", round(physical_red_prop, 3)))
print(paste("Computer bootstrap (1000 samples):", round(computer_red_prop, 3)))
print(paste("Your original sample:", round(original_red_prop, 3)))

difference_physical <- abs(physical_red_prop - original_red_prop)
difference_computer <- abs(computer_red_prop - original_red_prop)

print(paste("Physical bootstrap difference:", round(difference_physical, 3)))
print(paste("Computer bootstrap difference:", round(difference_computer, 3)))

print("🧠 CONCLUSION: More bootstrap samples usually get closer to the original!")
```

### 🎯 Bootstrap Challenges

**💡 Challenge 1: Prediction Challenge**
If you did another relay race with 20 more bootstrap samples, predict what you'd get:

**💡 Challenge 2: What If Challenge**
- What would happen with 100 bootstrap samples instead of 20?
- What if you forgot to put candies back during bootstrap?
- What if your original sample was very different?

**💡 Challenge 3: Real-World Connection**
Where might scientists use bootstrap sampling in real research?

## 📝 Bootstrap Notes

**Bootstrap Sample:** Sample WITH replacement from original data  
**Replacement:** Always put items back before sampling again  
**Bootstrap Distribution:** Pattern from many bootstrap samples  
**Key Insight:** Bootstrap simulates "many similar studies"  

**Physical Rule:** Grab → Record → Replace → Shake → Repeat  
**Statistical Rule:** Bootstrap approximates true sampling variability

**Remember:** Bootstrap magic works because your sample contains information about the population pattern!
