## 🎯 Mission Briefing
Discover the magical secrets of mean, median, and mode through different creature power distributions!

### 💡 What are Distributions?
Think of distributions like different ways data can be shaped - some are balanced (symmetrical), some lean to one side (skewed), and some have unusual outliers!

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load our magical libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)

# Load our magical creature dataset
#creatures <- read.csv("../datasets/magical_creatures_stats.csv")
creatures <- read.csv("docs/day04/datasets/magical_creatures_stats.csv")

# Let's peek at our data first
head(creatures)

# Separate each creature type for easier analysis
dragons <- creatures[creatures$creature_type == "dragon", ]
unicorns <- creatures[creatures$creature_type == "unicorn", ]
phoenixes <- creatures[creatures$creature_type == "phoenix", ]

cat("We have", nrow(dragons), "dragons,", nrow(unicorns), "unicorns, and", nrow(phoenixes), "phoenixes!")
```

## 🐉 Investigation 1: Dragon Power (Normal Distribution)

Dragons have very balanced power - most dragons are medium strength, with fewer very weak or very strong dragons.

```{r dragon-analysis}
# Create a histogram of dragon power
ggplot(dragons, aes(x = power_level)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "pink", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "🐉 Dragon Power Distribution (Normal/Symmetrical)", 
       x = "Dragon Power Level", 
       y = "Number of Dragons") +
  theme_minimal()

# Calculate statistics for dragon power
dragon_stats <- dragons %>%
  summarise(
    mean_power = mean(power_level),
    median_power = median(power_level),
    min_power = min(power_level),
    max_power = max(power_level)
  )

print("🐉 Dragon Power Statistics:")
print(dragon_stats)
```

### 💡 Key Learning
In symmetrical distributions, mean and median are very close!

---

## 🦄 Investigation 2: Unicorn Power (Left-Skewed Distribution)

Most unicorns have high power, but a few have very low power - this creates a "tail" on the left.

```{r unicorn-analysis}
# Create histogram of unicorn magic
ggplot(unicorns, aes(x = power_level)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightblue", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "🦄 Unicorn Power Distribution (Left-Skewed)", 
       x = "Unicorn Power Level", 
       y = "Number of Unicorns") +
  theme_minimal()

# Calculate statistics for unicorn power
unicorn_stats <- unicorns %>%
  summarise(
    mean_power = mean(power_level),
    median_power = median(power_level),
    min_power = min(power_level),
    max_power = max(power_level)
  )

print("🦄 Unicorn Power Statistics:")
print(unicorn_stats)
```

### 💡 Key Learning
In left-skewed distributions, the mean is PULLED DOWN by the low values!

---

## 🔥 Investigation 3: Phoenix Power (Right-Skewed Distribution)

Most phoenixes have low power, but a few have extremely high power - this creates a "tail" on the right.

```{r phoenix-analysis}
# Create histogram of phoenix energy
ggplot(phoenixes, aes(x = power_level)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "orange", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "🔥 Phoenix Power Distribution (Right-Skewed)", 
       x = "Phoenix Power Level", 
       y = "Number of Phoenixes") +
  theme_minimal()

# Calculate statistics for phoenix power
phoenix_stats <- phoenixes %>%
  summarise(
    mean_power = mean(power_level),
    median_power = median(power_level),
    min_power = min(power_level),
    max_power = max(power_level)
  )

print("🔥 Phoenix Power Statistics:")
print(phoenix_stats)
```

### 💡 Key Learning
In right-skewed distributions, the mean is PULLED UP by the high values!

## 🎨 Stacked Distribution Gallery

Let's see all three distributions stacked vertically in one beautiful view!

```{r stacked-distributions}
# Create individual plots
p1 <- ggplot(dragons, aes(x = power_level)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#48c33f", color = "black", alpha = 0.7, bins = 25) +
  labs(title = "🐉 Dragon Power (Normal Distribution)", 
       x = "Power Level", 
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5))

p2 <- ggplot(unicorns, aes(x = power_level)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "purple", color = "black", alpha = 0.7, bins = 25) +
  labs(title = "🦄 Unicorn Power (Left-Skewed Distribution)", 
       x = "Power Level", 
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5))

p3 <- ggplot(phoenixes, aes(x = power_level)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "orange", color = "black", alpha = 0.7, bins = 25) +
  labs(title = "🔥 Phoenix Power (Right-Skewed Distribution)", 
       x = "Power Level", 
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5))

# Stack them in a 3x1 grid (3 rows, 1 column)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 3, ncol = 1)
```

### 💡 What Do You Notice?
Look at how different each shape is! Can you see the "tails" and where most of the data clusters?

## 🔍 The Great Comparison Challenge

Let's compare all three distributions with numbers!

```{r comparison}
# Combine all the statistics
all_stats <- data.frame(
  Creature = c("Dragon (Normal)", "Unicorn (Left-Skewed)", "Phoenix (Right-Skewed)"),
  Mean = c(dragon_stats$mean_power, unicorn_stats$mean_power, phoenix_stats$mean_power),
  Median = c(dragon_stats$median_power, unicorn_stats$median_power, phoenix_stats$median_power),
  Difference = c(
    abs(dragon_stats$mean_power - dragon_stats$median_power),
    abs(unicorn_stats$mean_power - unicorn_stats$median_power),
    abs(phoenix_stats$mean_power - phoenix_stats$median_power)
  )
)

print("📊 The Great Statistics Comparison:")
print(all_stats)
```

### 💡 Mystery Question
Which creature type has the biggest difference between mean and median? Why?

---

## 💡 Take-Home Messages

1. **Symmetrical distributions:** Mean ≈ Median (they're close friends!)
2. **Left-skewed distributions:** Mean < Median (mean gets pulled down)
3. **Right-skewed distributions:** Mean > Median (mean gets pulled up)
4. **When data is skewed,** median is often a better measure of "typical" value

### 🎈 Your Turn!
Try running each code chunk and observe how the different distribution shapes affect the relationship between mean, median, and mode. Can you explain why the mean "moves" toward the tail in skewed distributions?
