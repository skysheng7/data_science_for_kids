# 🔮 Day 4 - Spell 6: Halloween Candy Analysis

## 🎯 Mission: Analyze Our Enchanted Forest Candy Investigation

Welcome, Statistical Wizards! It's time to analyze the data from our magical candy investigation. We'll examine both rounds of the Enchanted Forest Neighborhood candy count to see how our sampling worked and who made the best predictions!

## 📊 Step 1: Setting Up Our Magic Tools

```{r load-packages}
# 💡 Load our magical data analysis tools
library(ggplot2)  # For beautiful visualizations
library(dplyr)    # For data cleaning and manipulation
```

## 🧹 Step 2: Set Parameters and Load Round 1 Data

```{r set-parameters}
# 🎯 Set the maximum number of candies possible in each bag
MAX_CANDIES_PER_BAG <- 10  # Change this if needed!

# 🏰 Set the safety threshold (80% or more means SAFE)
SAFETY_THRESHOLD <- 80

cat("🎃 Maximum candies per bag:", MAX_CANDIES_PER_BAG, "\n")
cat("🛡️ Safety threshold:", SAFETY_THRESHOLD, "% (>= this percentage means SAFE)\n")
```

```{r load-round1}
# 💡 Load Round 1 candy count data
# Make sure this CSV file is in your datasets folder!

# Round 1 data (replace with your actual file name)
#round1_data <- read.csv("../datasets/candy_round1.csv")
round1_data <- read.csv("docs/day04/datasets/candy_round1.csv")

# Let's peek at our data structure
cat("🔍 Round 1 Data Structure:\n")
head(round1_data)
```

```{r clean-round1}
# 🧹 Clean Round 1 data - use only columns 2, 3, 4 and clean data types

# Function to clean candy data
clean_candy_data <- function(data, round_name) {
  # Select only columns 2, 3, 4 and rename them
  cleaned <- data %>%
    select(
      wizard_name = 2,      # Column 2: wizard name
      candy_count_raw = 3,  # Column 3: candy count
      decision = 4          # Column 4: decision
    ) %>%
    # Convert candy count to numeric and clean invalid entries
    mutate(
      candy_count = as.numeric(candy_count_raw),
      round = round_name
    ) %>%
    # Remove rows with invalid candy counts (NA, negative, or above maximum)
    filter(
      !is.na(candy_count), 
      candy_count >= 0, 
      candy_count <= MAX_CANDIES_PER_BAG
    ) %>%
    # Calculate candy percentage
    mutate(
      candy_percentage = candy_count / MAX_CANDIES_PER_BAG * 100
    ) %>%
    # Keep only the columns we need
    select(wizard_name, candy_count, candy_percentage, decision, round)
  
  return(cleaned)
}

# Clean Round 1 dataset
round1_clean <- clean_candy_data(round1_data, "Round 1")

cat("✨ Round 1 Cleaned Data Summary:\n")
cat("Total wizards:", nrow(round1_clean), "\n")
cat("Valid candy counts range:", min(round1_clean$candy_count), "to", max(round1_clean$candy_count), "\n")
```

## 📈 Step 4: Round 1 Analysis

### 4.1 Sampling Distribution for Round 1

```{r round1-distribution}
# 📊 Create a histogram showing everyone's candy percentages from Round 1
ggplot(round1_clean, aes(x = candy_percentage)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "orange", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE, color = "red", size = 2, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(round1_clean$candy_percentage), color = "blue", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "🎃 Round 1: Sampling Distribution of Candy Percentages",
    subtitle = paste("Red line = True value (", TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE, "%), Blue line = Sample average"),
    x = "Candy Percentage (%)",
    y = "Number of Wizards"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

### 4.2 Calculate Round 1 Statistics

```{r round1-stats}
# 📊 Calculate important statistics for Round 1
round1_avg <- mean(round1_clean$candy_percentage)
round1_std <- sd(round1_clean$candy_percentage)

cat("🎯 Round 1 Results:\n")
cat("Sample average:", round(round1_avg, 2), "%\n")
cat("True population parameter:", TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE, "%\n")
cat("Difference from truth:", round(abs(round1_avg - TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE), 2), "%\n")
cat("Sample standard deviation:", round(round1_std, 2), "%\n")
```

### 4.3 Who Got It Right in Round 1?

```{r round1-winners}
# 🏆 Find wizards who made the correct prediction in Round 1
round1_with_correct <- round1_clean %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_answer = case_when(
      grepl("SAFE", decision, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "SAFE",
      grepl("CURSED", decision, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "CURSED",
      TRUE ~ "UNKNOWN"
    ),
    got_it_right = predicted_answer == CORRECT_ANSWER
  )

# List the winners
round1_winners <- round1_with_correct %>%
  filter(got_it_right == TRUE)

cat("🏆 Round 1 Winners (Wizards who got it right):\n")
if(nrow(round1_winners) > 0) {
  for(i in seq_len(nrow(round1_winners))) {
    cat("⭐", round1_winners$wizard_name[i], "- Found", round1_winners$candy_count[i], "candies\n")
  }
} else {
  cat("No wizards got it exactly right this round!\n")
}

# Count SAFE vs CURSED predictions
round1_summary <- round1_with_correct %>%
  count(predicted_answer) %>%
  filter(predicted_answer %in% c("SAFE", "CURSED"))

cat("\n📊 Round 1 Prediction Summary:\n")
for(i in seq_len(nrow(round1_summary))) {
  cat(round1_summary$predicted_answer[i], ":", round1_summary$n[i], "wizards\n")
}
```

## 📈 Step 5: Round 2 Analysis

### 5.1 Sampling Distribution for Round 2

```{r round2-distribution}
# 📊 Create a histogram showing everyone's candy percentages from Round 2
ggplot(round2_clean, aes(x = candy_percentage)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "purple", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE, color = "red", size = 2, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(round2_clean$candy_percentage), color = "blue", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "🎃 Round 2: Sampling Distribution of Candy Percentages",
    subtitle = paste("Red line = True value (", TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE, "%), Blue line = Sample average"),
    x = "Candy Percentage (%)",
    y = "Number of Wizards"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

### 5.2 Calculate Round 2 Statistics

```{r round2-stats}
# 📊 Calculate important statistics for Round 2
round2_avg <- mean(round2_clean$candy_percentage)
round2_std <- sd(round2_clean$candy_percentage)

cat("🎯 Round 2 Results:\n")
cat("Sample average:", round(round2_avg, 2), "%\n")
cat("True population parameter:", TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE, "%\n")
cat("Difference from truth:", round(abs(round2_avg - TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE), 2), "%\n")
cat("Sample standard deviation:", round(round2_std, 2), "%\n")
```

### 5.3 Who Got It Right in Round 2?

```{r round2-winners}
# 🏆 Find wizards who made the correct prediction in Round 2
round2_with_correct <- round2_clean %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_answer = case_when(
      grepl("SAFE", decision, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "SAFE",
      grepl("CURSED", decision, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "CURSED",
      TRUE ~ "UNKNOWN"
    ),
    got_it_right = predicted_answer == CORRECT_ANSWER
  )

# List the winners
round2_winners <- round2_with_correct %>%
  filter(got_it_right == TRUE)

cat("🏆 Round 2 Winners (Wizards who got it right):\n")
if(nrow(round2_winners) > 0) {
  for(i in seq_len(nrow(round2_winners))) {
    cat("⭐", round2_winners$wizard_name[i], "- Found", round2_winners$candy_count[i], "candies\n")
  }
} else {
  cat("No wizards got it exactly right this round!\n")
}

# Count SAFE vs CURSED predictions
round2_summary <- round2_with_correct %>%
  count(predicted_answer) %>%
  filter(predicted_answer %in% c("SAFE", "CURSED"))

cat("\n📊 Round 2 Prediction Summary:\n")
for(i in seq_len(nrow(round2_summary))) {
  cat(round2_summary$predicted_answer[i], ":", round2_summary$n[i], "wizards\n")
}
```

## 🔍 Step 6: Compare Both Rounds

### 6.1 Overlay the Distributions

```{r overlay-distributions}
# 🎨 Combine both datasets for comparison
combined_data <- bind_rows(round1_clean, round2_clean)

# Create overlapping histograms
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = candy_percentage, fill = round)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, alpha = 0.6, position = "identity", color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE, color = "red", size = 2, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = round1_avg, color = "orange", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = round2_avg, color = "purple", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Round 1" = "orange", "Round 2" = "purple")) +
  labs(
    title = "🎃 Comparison: Round 1 vs Round 2 Sampling Distributions",
    subtitle = "Red = True value, Orange dotted = Round 1 avg, Purple dotted = Round 2 avg",
    x = "Candy Percentage (%)",
    y = "Number of Wizards",
    fill = "Round"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

### 6.2 Statistical Comparison

```{r compare-rounds}
cat("🔮 FINAL COMPARISON RESULTS:\n")
cat(paste(rep("=", 50), collapse = ""), "\n")

cat("📊 Sample Averages:\n")
cat("Round 1 average:", round(round1_avg, 2), "% (difference from truth:", round(abs(round1_avg - TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE), 2), "%)\n")
cat("Round 2 average:", round(round2_avg, 2), "% (difference from truth:", round(abs(round2_avg - TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE), 2), "%)\n")

cat("\n📏 Sample Spreads (Standard Deviation):\n")
cat("Round 1 spread:", round(round1_std, 2), "%\n")
cat("Round 2 spread:", round(round2_std, 2), "%\n")

# Determine which round was closer to truth
round1_error <- abs(round1_avg - TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE)
round2_error <- abs(round2_avg - TRUE_CANDY_PERCENTAGE)

if(round1_error < round2_error) {
  winner_round <- "Round 1"
  better_error <- round1_error
} else if(round2_error < round1_error) {
  winner_round <- "Round 2"
  better_error <- round2_error
} else {
  winner_round <- "TIE"
  better_error <- round1_error
}

cat("\n🏆 WINNER: ", winner_round, " was closer to the true population parameter!\n")
if(winner_round != "TIE") {
  cat("📈 The winning round was only", round(better_error, 2), "% away from the truth!\n")
}

cat("\n🎯 Sample Sizes:\n")
cat("Round 1:", nrow(round1_clean), "wizards\n")
cat("Round 2:", nrow(round2_clean), "wizards\n")

# Check if the larger sample was more accurate
larger_sample_round <- ifelse(nrow(round1_clean) > nrow(round2_clean), "Round 1", 
                             ifelse(nrow(round2_clean) > nrow(round1_clean), "Round 2", "Same"))

cat("\n💡 Magic Learning:\n")
if(larger_sample_round != "Same") {
  cat("The larger sample size was in", larger_sample_round, "\n")
  if((larger_sample_round == "Round 1" && round1_error < round2_error) ||
     (larger_sample_round == "Round 2" && round2_error < round1_error)) {
    cat("✅ As expected, the larger sample gave us a result closer to the truth!\n")
  } else {
    cat("🤔 Interesting! The larger sample wasn't more accurate this time - that's the randomness of sampling!\n")
  }
}
```

## 🎉 Step 7: Celebration and Learning Summary

```{r final-summary}
cat("🎊 CONGRATULATIONS, STATISTICAL WIZARDS! 🎊\n")
cat(paste(rep("=", 50), collapse = ""), "\n")

cat("🔮 What We Discovered:\n")
cat("• Sampling variability is real - different samples give different results!\n")
cat("• Even with randomness, our sample averages got close to the true value\n")
cat("• Larger samples generally give more reliable results\n")
cat("• Every wizard's data contributed to our understanding!\n")

total_winners <- nrow(round1_winners) + nrow(round2_winners)
cat("\n🏆 Total Prediction Winners Across Both Rounds:", total_winners, "wizards!\n")

cat("\n✨ Remember: In real statistical work, we usually don't know the true population parameter - \n")
cat("   that's what makes sampling and estimation so important!\n")
```

## 💡 Key Learning Points:

1. **Sampling Variability**: Different samples from the same population give different results
2. **Sample Average**: Tends to be close to the true population parameter, especially with larger samples
3. **Spread**: Shows how much variation there is in our sample results
4. **Sample Size Matters**: Larger samples generally give more reliable estimates
5. **Prediction Accuracy**: Even with sampling variability, statistical methods help us make good predictions!
