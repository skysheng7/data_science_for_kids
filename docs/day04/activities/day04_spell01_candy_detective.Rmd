# 🔮 Day 4 - Spell 1: Candy Shop Detective Investigation

## 🕵️ The Great Candy Mystery Challenge

Welcome, elite detectives! You've been called to investigate mysterious bags of candy evidence. Your mission: solve the THREE statistical mysteries using your detective tools.

### 🍬 Physical Detective Work (Do This First!)

**Before touching the computer, complete your physical investigation:**

1. **Sort the Evidence:** Carefully sort your candies by color into neat piles
2. **Count Each Color:** Count how many candies of each color you have
3. **Record Your Findings:** Write down your counts on paper first

**Detective Report Template:**
```
Team Name: _______________
Evidence Bag #: _______________

Red candies: _____
Blue candies: _____
Green candies: _____
Yellow candies: _____
Orange candies: _____
(Add more colors if needed)
```

### 🔍 Digital Detective Analysis

Now let's solve the three mysteries using R magic!

```{r}
# 🕵️ Enter your evidence data here
# Replace these numbers with your actual candy counts

red_count <- ...      # How many red candies?
blue_count <- ...     # How many blue candies?
green_count <- ...    # How many green candies?
yellow_count <- ...   # How many yellow candies?
orange_count <- ...   # How many orange candies?

# Create your evidence vector
candy_counts <- c(red_count, blue_count, green_count, yellow_count, orange_count)
color_names <- c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Orange")

# Display your evidence
print("🍬 Evidence Report:")
for(i in 1:length(candy_counts)) {
  cat(color_names[i], "candies:", candy_counts[i], "\n")
}
```

### 🔍 Mystery #1: Mean Mission

**The Question:** What's the average number of candies per color?

```{r}
# Calculate the mean (average)
mean_candies <- mean(candy_counts)

print(paste("🔍 Mystery #1 SOLVED!"))
print(paste("Average candies per color:", round(mean_candies, 2)))

# 💡 What does this mean?
# If you shared all your candies equally among the colors, 
# each color would get this many candies!
```

### 🔍 Mystery #2: Median Mystery

**The Question:** What's the middle value when you arrange the counts?

```{r}
# Sort the counts and find the median
sorted_counts <- sort(candy_counts)
median_candies <- median(candy_counts)

print("🔍 Mystery #2 SOLVED!")
print(paste("Sorted counts:", paste(sorted_counts, collapse = ", ")))
print(paste("Median (middle value):", median_candies))

# 💡 What does this mean?
# Half your colors have more than this amount,
# half have less than this amount!
```

### 🔍 Mystery #3: Mode Madness

**The Question:** Which color appears most often?

```{r}
# Find the mode (most frequent count)
count_table <- table(candy_counts)
mode_count <- as.numeric(names(count_table)[which.max(count_table)])

# Find which color(s) have the mode count
mode_colors <- color_names[candy_counts == mode_count]

print("🔍 Mystery #3 SOLVED!")
print(paste("Most common count:", mode_count))
print(paste("Color(s) with this count:", paste(mode_colors, collapse = ", ")))

# 💡 What does this mean?
# This count appears most often among your colors!
```

### 🏆 Detective Summary Report

```{r}
print("🏆 CASE CLOSED! Detective Summary:")
print("================================")
print(paste("👥 Team:", "YOUR_TEAM_NAME_HERE"))
print(paste("📊 Total candies:", sum(candy_counts)))
print(paste("📈 Mean (average):", round(mean_candies, 2)))
print(paste("📍 Median (middle):", median_candies))
print(paste("🎯 Mode (most common count):", mode_count))
print(paste("🌈 Number of different colors:", length(candy_counts)))
```

### 🎯 Detective Challenges

**💡 Challenge 1:** Which mystery was easiest to solve? Why?

**💡 Challenge 2:** Compare your results with other detective teams. Are they the same or different? Why might this happen?

**💡 Challenge 3:** If you could take one more candy from the evidence bag, which color would you choose to make the mean higher?

### 🍭 Bonus: Evidence Visualization

```{r}
# Create a bar chart of your evidence
barplot(candy_counts, 
        names.arg = color_names,
        col = c("red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange"),
        main = "🍬 Candy Evidence Analysis",
        ylab = "Number of Candies",
        xlab = "Colors")

# Add your statistics as text
abline(h = mean_candies, col = "black", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
text(1, mean_candies + 0.5, paste("Mean =", round(mean_candies, 2)), pos = 4)
```

### 🎉 Investigation Complete!

**🕵️ Detective Badge Earned:** You've successfully solved all three statistical mysteries! You now understand the power of mean, median, and mode in data detective work.

**💡 Key Learning:** These three measures help us understand what's "typical" or "central" in our data - just like finding the middle of a group of kids!

**🍬 Evidence Disposal:** You may now safely dispose of the candy evidence by eating it! 🎊

## 📝 Investigation Notes

**Mean (Average):** Add all values and divide by count  
**Median (Middle):** Sort values and find the center  
**Mode (Most Common):** Find which value appears most often  

**Remember:** Different detective teams will get different results because they have different evidence bags - that's the magic of sampling variability!
