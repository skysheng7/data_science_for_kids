## 1. Game 1: Candy Shop Detective Championship 🕵️
*Duration: 40 minutes*

### 1.1 The Great Candy Mystery Setup
*Duration: 5 minutes*

💡 **The Mission:** Each team becomes elite candy shop detectives investigating mysterious bags of evidence (colorful candies)! Your job is to solve THREE statistical mysteries using detective tools called mean, median, and mode.

**🎯 Team Names:** Choose your detective squad name:

## 2. Game 2: Random Grab Championship 🎲
*Duration: 45 minutes*

### 2.1 The Great Ocean Sampling Challenge Setup
*Duration: 10 minutes*

💡 **What is Sampling?**
Imagine you want to know how many fish are in the entire ocean, but you can't count them all! So you take a net, catch some fish, count those, and use that to guess about the whole ocean. That's sampling!

**🌊 Population** = All the fish in the ocean (everything we want to know about)
**🎣 Sample** = The fish we caught in our net (the small group we actually study)

**Today's Challenge:** The teacher has a GIANT bowl of mixed candies (the ocean population). Your mission: grab samples and see what happens!

### Spell 2: Random Grab Championship
*Duration: 25 minutes*

#### 🎈 Activity: The Blind Grab Competition

**🍬 Physical Championship Rules:**
1. **The Population Bowl:** One giant bowl with mixed candies (red, blue, green, yellow, orange)
2. **Blind Grab Challenge:** Each kid does a "blind grab" of exactly 10 candies (their sample)
3. **No Peeking:** Eyes closed or blindfolded for fair sampling!
4. **Record Results:** Count each color and write on the big classroom chart
5. **Team Competition:** Which team can grab the most representative samples?

**🏆 Championship Rounds:**
- **Round 1:** Individual blind grabs
- **Round 2:** Speed sampling (30 seconds per team)
- **Round 3:** Compare results - why are they all different?

📁 **Find this spell in Posit Cloud:** Look for the file `day04_spell02_random_grab.Rmd` in your project files!

💡 **The Magic Discovery:** Different samples give different results! This is called **sampling variability** - and it's totally normal!

<img src="PLACEHOLDER_GIF_URL" alt="Kids doing blind grab sampling from candy bowl" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

### 2.2 Digital Data Collection Magic
*Duration: 10 minutes*

### Spell 3: Google Form Data Blast
#### 🎈 Activity: Real-Time Results Explosion

**📱 Digital Extension:**
- Enter your grab results into the Google Form
- Watch the real-time classroom results appear on the big screen

**🤯 Mind-Blowing Moment:** Even though everyone got different results, together we can see the true pattern of the population!

## 3. Game 3: Bootstrap Bootcamp Relay Race 🔄
*Duration: 45 minutes*

### 3.1 The Time Machine Challenge Setup
*Duration: 10 minutes*

💡 **What is Bootstrapping?**
Imagine you have only one bag of candies, but you want to know what would happen if you had many bags like it. Bootstrapping is like a time machine - you sample from your one bag WITH replacement (putting candies back) to simulate having many similar bags!

**🕐 The Magic:** We can travel through time by sampling WITH replacement!

### Spell 4: Bootstrap Bootcamp Relay
*Duration: 35 minutes*

#### 🎈 Activity: The Ultimate Replacement Relay Challenge

**🏃‍♀️ Physical Relay Race Setup:**
- **Station 1:** Sample Grabber (grab 1 candy)
- **Station 2:** Color Recorder (write down the color)  
- **Station 3:** Replacer (put candy back and shake bag)
- **Station 4:** Counter (tally the results)

**🏆 Relay Race Rules:**
1. Teams line up at Station 1
2. Each team member does one complete rotation through all stations
3. **Key Rule:** Always put the candy back! (This is bootstrap magic)
4. Race to complete 20 bootstrap samples first
5. Calculate your team's bootstrap mean

**🎯 The Ultimate Challenge:** Which team can bootstrap fastest while getting results closest to the true population?

📁 **Find this spell in Posit Cloud:** Look for the file `day04_spell04_bootstrap_bootcamp.Rmd` in your project files!

💡 **The Big Discovery:** Bootstrapping from one sample gives us similar information to taking many samples from the population!

## 4. Game 4: R Magic + Confidence Interval Casino 🎰
*Duration: 40 minutes*

### 4.1 Welcome to the Statistical Casino
*Duration: 10 minutes*

💡 **What is a Confidence Interval?**
Think of it like this: If someone asks "How tall are the students in your school?" you might say "Most are between 140cm and 160cm tall." That's a confidence interval - a range where we think the true answer lies!

**🎰 Casino Challenge:** Use your bootstrap data to "bet" on where the true population mean lies!

### Spell 5: Confidence Interval Casino Challenge
*Duration: 30 minutes*

#### 🎈 Activity: The Greatest Statistical Bet Ever

**🎮 Casino Game Setup:**
1. **Input Your Data:** Enter your bootstrap results into the pre-loaded R script
2. **R Magic Happens:** Watch R generate cool confidence interval visualizations
3. **Place Your Bet:** Predict whether the true population mean falls in your interval
4. **The Big Reveal:** Teacher counts the actual population bowl
5. **Winners Circle:** Teams with correct intervals get extra candy!

📁 **Find this spell in Posit Cloud:** Look for the file `day04_spell05_confidence_casino.Rmd` in your project files!

**🏆 Casino Scoring:**
- Correct 90% confidence interval bet: 5 points
- Correct 95% confidence interval bet: 10 points  
- Correct 99% confidence interval bet: 15 points
- **Jackpot:** If your interval captures the true mean: 20 bonus points!

💡 **Casino Wisdom:** Being more confident (99% vs 90%) means you need a wider net to catch the true answer - but you're more likely to win!

- **Station 1: "Careful Counter"** - Systematic sampling (every 3rd candy)
- **Station 2: "Speed Sampler"** - Rushed random (grab fast!)
- **Station 3: "Color Picker"** - Biased sampling (only grab your favorite colors)
- **Station 4: "Blindfold Challenge"** - True random sampling (eyes closed)
- **Station 5: "Tiny Sample Snatcher"** - Small samples (only 3 candies)

**🔄 Rotation Rules:**
- 4 minutes per station
- Record results at each station
- Compare final results across all methods

📁 **Find this spell in Posit Cloud:** Look for the file `day04_spell06_sampling_chaos.Rmd` in your project files!

# Basic stats detective tools
mean(candy_counts)           # Calculate average
median(candy_counts)         # Find middle value
table(candy_colors)          # Count each color

# Sampling and bootstrap
sample(colors, 10, replace = TRUE)    # Bootstrap sample
quantile(bootstrap_means, c(0.05, 0.95))  # 90% confidence interval
```
