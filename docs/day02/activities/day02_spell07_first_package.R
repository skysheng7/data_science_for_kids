# ðŸ”® Day 2 - Spell 7: Your First Package - ggplot2

# ðŸŽˆ Activity: Installing Your First Magic Tool
# ðŸ“¦ Learn what packages are and how to use them!

# ðŸ’¡ What is a Package?
# Think of packages like apps on your phone - each one adds new powers to R!

# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 1: Install and load ggplot2

# Step 1: Install the package (like downloading an app)
# Note: You only need to do this once!
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Step 2: Load the package (like opening the app)  
# Note: You need to do this every time you start R!
library(ggplot2)

# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 2: Check if it worked
# Test if ggplot2 is loaded by running a simple command
ggplot()

# Expected: You should see an empty gray plot window - this means ggplot2 is working!

# ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:
# - Packages are like apps that add new powers to R
# - install.packages() downloads them once (like downloading an app)
# - library() opens them each time you want to use them (like opening the app)

# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 3: Practice installing another package
# Let's install the "dplyr" package (we'll use it later!)
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# âœ¨ Challenge: Can you find out what dplyr does?
# Hint: Try using the help system you learned in Spell 6!
?dplyr
