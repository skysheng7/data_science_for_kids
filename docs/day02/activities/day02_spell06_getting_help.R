# ðŸ”® Day 2 - Spell 6: Getting Help with the Magic `?`

# ðŸŽˆ Activity: The Help Detective
# ðŸ†˜ Learn how to get help when you don't know how something works!

# ðŸ’¡ The Magic Question Mark
# In R, when you don't know how something works, just type `?` before the function name!

# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 1: Explore the print function
?print

# Expected: A help page will show up with:
# - Description: What print() does
# - Usage: How to use it  
# - Examples: Code you can try!

# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 2: Get help with paste
?paste

# Expected: Help documentation explaining how paste() combines strings

# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 3: Try it yourself!
# Pick any function you've learned and explore it

?mean
?c
# ?for  # This one might not work - for is special!

# ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: The `?` is like having a friendly helper who explains 
# how any function works!

# âœ¨ Challenge: Pick 3 functions you've learned and explore their help pages
# Write down one new thing you learned about each function:

# Function 1: _______________
# New thing I learned: _______________

# Function 2: _______________  
# New thing I learned: _______________

# Function 3: _______________
# New thing I learned: _______________
