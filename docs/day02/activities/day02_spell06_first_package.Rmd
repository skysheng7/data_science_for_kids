## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 1: Install and load ggplot2

Step 1: Install the package (like downloading an app)
Note: You only need to do this once!

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Step 2: Load the package (like opening the app)  
Note: You need to do this every time you start R!

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 2: Check if it worked
Test if ggplot2 is loaded by running a simple command

```{r}
ggplot()
```

Expected: You should see an empty gray plot window - this means ggplot2 is working!

---

## âœ¨ Challenge: Can you find out what ggplot2 does?
Hint: Try using the help system you learned in Spell 5!

```{r eval=FALSE}
?ggplot2
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:
- Packages are like apps that add new powers to R
- install.packages() downloads them once (like downloading an app)
- library() opens them each time you want to use them (like opening the app)
