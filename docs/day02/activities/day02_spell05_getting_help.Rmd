## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 1: Explore the print function with ?

```{r eval=FALSE}
?print
```

Expected: A help page will show up with:
- Description: What print() does
- Usage: How to use it  
- Examples: Code you can try!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 2: Get help with paste

```{r eval=FALSE}
?paste
```

Expected: Help documentation explaining how paste() combines strings

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 3: Try the super search with ??
What if you don't know the exact function name? Use ?? to search!

```{r eval=FALSE}
??plotting
```

Expected: A list of ALL functions related to plotting!
This is like asking "Show me everything about plotting"

```{r eval=FALSE}
??statistics
```

Expected: A list of functions related to statistics

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 4: Compare ? vs ??
Try both and see the difference!

```{r eval=FALSE}
?plot         # Specific help for plot function
??plot        # All functions related to "plot"
```

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: 
- `?` = Get help for ONE specific function (like asking about a specific spell)
- `??` = Search for ALL functions related to a topic (like asking "show me all fire spells")
