# 🎈 Activity: Secret Message Encoder & Decoder
🕵️ Turn yourself into a data spy! Create secret codes and decode messages!

## 📚 The Magic Story to scramble:

```{r}
original_story <- "In the Magic Forest, a smart rabbit and a tiny dragon became friends, built a flying boat out of leaves, and sailed through the sky to save a sleepy bear cub who was stuck on a candy cloud."

# First, let's split the story into individual words
# Note: unlist(strsplit()) is a magical spell that splits a string into a list of words
story_words <- unlist(strsplit(original_story, " "))
print("🔤 Original story words:")
print(story_words)
print(paste("📊 Total words:", length(story_words)))
```

## 🎯 Challenge 1: Reverse Word Order Spy Code
🔄 Like reading a sentence backwards to confuse enemies!

```{r}
print("\n🚀 === CHALLENGE 1: REVERSE SPY CODE ===")

# Step 1: Create reversed word list
reversed_words <- c()
for (i in length(story_words):1) {
  reversed_words <- c(reversed_words, story_words[i])  
}

# Step 2: Print the reversed story
print("🔒 ENCODED (Backwards):")
reversed_story <- paste(reversed_words, collapse = " ")
print(...)  # TODO Fill in: what should we print?

# Step 3: Restore original order  
original_words <- c()
for (i in length(reversed_words):1) {
  original_words <- c(original_words, reversed_words[...])  # TODO Fill in: what goes here in ...?
}
print("\n🔓 DECODED (Original Order):")
original_restored <- paste(original_words, collapse = " ")
print(...)  # TODO Fill in: what should we print?
```

## 🎯 Challenge 2: Every-Other-Word Spy Code
🔀 Mix up words by putting odd positions first, then even positions!

```{r}
print("\n🚀 === CHALLENGE 2: EVERY-OTHER-WORD SPY CODE ===")

# Step 1: Create empty lists for odd and even positioned words
odd_words <- c()
even_words <- c()

# Step 2: Separate words by position (odd vs even)
for (i in 1:length(story_words)) {
  # Note: %% is the "remainder" operator (great for finding odd/even numbers!)
  if (i %% 2 == 1) {  # Odd positions (1, 3, 5, etc.)
    odd_words <- c(odd_words, story_words[...])  # Fill in: what goes here?
  } else {  # Even positions (2, 4, 6, etc.)
    even_words <- c(even_words, story_words[...])  # Fill in: what goes here?
  }
}

# Step 3: Create encoded message (odds + separator + evens)
encoded_words <- c(odd_words, "---", even_words)
print("🔒 ENCODED (Every-other-word):")
encoded_story <- paste(encoded_words, collapse = " ")
print(encoded_story)  

# Step 4: Decode back to original (combine odd and even in correct order)
decoded_words <- c()
for (i in 1:max(length(odd_words), length(even_words))) {
  if (i <= length(odd_words)) {
    decoded_words <- c(decoded_words, odd_words[...])  # Fill in: what goes here?
  }
  if (i <= length(even_words)) {
    decoded_words <- c(decoded_words, even_words[...])  # Fill in: what goes here?
  }
}

print("🔓 DECODED (Original Order):")
decoded_story <- paste(decoded_words, collapse = " ")
print(...)  # Fill in: what should we print?
```

## 🎮 Bonus: Try Your Own Secret Messages!
🤐 Create secret codes to share with friends!

```{r}
print("\n🎮 === BONUS: YOUR SECRET MESSAGES ===")

# Try these mini stories or create your own!
mini_secret1 <- "Meet me at the playground after school."
mini_secret2 <- "I found the hidden treasure map."
mini_secret3 <- "The password is rainbow unicorn."

# Your turn: Pick one of the mini secrets and encode it!
my_secret <- "..."  # Fill in: choose one of the mini_secret messages above

# Split your secret into words
my_words <- unlist(strsplit(my_secret, " "))

# Encode using Method 1 (Reverse) or Method 2 (Every-other-word)
# Write your encoding code here:

```

## 💡 Memory Tips: 
- length() tells you how many items are in a list
- %% finds remainders (i %% 2 == 1 means odd numbers)
- paste(words, collapse = " ") joins words back into a sentence, seperating by " "
- Use i:1 for backwards loops, 1:i for forward loops
- c() creates or adds to lists: new_list <- c(old_list, new_item)
