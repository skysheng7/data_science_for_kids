```R
# Create scatter plot to see relationship
pf_scatter <- ggplot(school_data, aes(x = potion_score, y = flying_score, color = house)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Potion vs Flying Scores",
       x = "Potion Score", y = "Flying Score", color = "House") +
  theme_minimal()
print(pf_scatter)
```

### Challenge: Students from which house has the best score on average?

```R
# Calculate overall average score for each house
house_analysis <- school_data %>%
  mutate(overall_score = (magic_score + potion_score + flying_score) / 3) %>%
  group_by(house) %>%
  summarize(avg_overall = mean(overall_score), count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_overall))

print("Average overall scores by house:")
print(house_analysis)

# Visualize the results
house_plot <- ggplot(house_analysis, aes(x = house, y = avg_overall, fill = house)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Average Overall Score by House",
       x = "House", y = "Average Overall Score", fill = "House")
print(house_plot)
```
