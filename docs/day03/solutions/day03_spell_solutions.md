# ðŸ”® Day 3 Spell Solutions

This file contains solutions to all Day 3 spells and their practice challenges.

## Spell 1: Loading Data Magic

### Complete Solution Code:
```R
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Load the creature data - using practice data first
creature_data <- read.csv("datasets/creature_of_sky.csv")
# For later: creature_data <- read.csv("datasets/creatures.csv")
print("Data loaded successfully!")

# Explore the data
head(creature_data)
nrow(creature_data)
ncol(creature_data)
names(creature_data)
```

### Expected Output:
```R
# For head(creature_data) using creature_of_sky.csv:
