Work with a partner to solve a data mystery!
Use all your new data magic skills together

## 🕵️‍♀️ Mission: Choose Your Mystery!

Pick ONE mystery or multiple mysteries to solve with your partner by opening the scripts below.
Each script uses ONE dataset so you can focus clearly:
- day03_spell08A_creatures_project.R (uses creatures.csv)
- day03_spell08B_magical_pets_project.R (uses magical_pets.csv)
- day03_spell08C_creature_sightings_project.R (uses creature_sightings.csv)
- day03_spell08D_magic_school_project.R (uses magic_school_grades.csv)

## Step 1: Load your detective toolkit

```{r}
# set the locale to English and UTF-8 encoding so that emojis can be displayed correctly
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "en_US.UTF-8")

# load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

print("🔍 Detective toolkit loaded!")
print("👫 Ready to solve mysteries with your partner!")
```

Open ONE of the dataset-specific project files listed above to begin.

## Step 2: Investigation Template

Use this template in your chosen project script:

### 1. EXPLORE: Look at your data
```{r eval=FALSE}
head(your_data)
names(your_data)
summary(your_data)
```

### 2. FILTER: Find specific clues
```{r eval=FALSE}
important_clues <- filter(your_data, some_condition)
```

### 3. SELECT: Pick important information
```{r eval=FALSE}
key_info <- select(important_clues, important_columns)
```

### 4. GROUP AND SUMMARIZE: Count and calculate
```{r eval=FALSE}
summary_stats <- your_data %>%
  group_by(some_group) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), average = mean(some_number))
```

### 5. VISUALIZE: Create a plot to show your findings
```{r eval=FALSE}
mystery_plot <- ggplot(your_data, aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
  geom_point() +  # or geom_col() or geom_histogram()
  labs(title = "Your Discovery Title",
       x = "X-axis label",
       y = "Y-axis label")+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 19))
```

## Step 3: Present Your Findings!

When you're done investigating:
1. What did you discover?
2. What does your visualization show?
3. What story does your data tell?

```{r}
print("🎉 Great detective work!")
print("👥 Share your findings with the class!")
```

## 💡 Detective Tips:
- Work together! Two detectives are better than one
- Ask lots of questions about your data
- Try different visualizations to see patterns
- Don't be afraid to experiment
