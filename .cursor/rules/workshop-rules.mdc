# Data Science for Kids Summer Camp - Cursor Rules

## Workshop Overview
This repository contains materials for a 5-day, 3-hour per day, Data Science for Kids summer camp designed for ages 10-14. The workshop introduces fundamental data science concepts through hands-on activities, storytelling, and creative projects using R programming.

## Workshop Theme: A magical otter, Oda, who is a data science wizard!
- **Mascot**: An otter who is a friendly hacker with magical data powers.

## Important Overall Instruction
- Write in simple languages that is suitable for kids 10-14 years old
- Write in a clear, easy to understand way, DO NOT write more than necessary
- Write in an encouraging, inclusive, considerate tone
- Please be considerate and inclusive, DO NOT assume every kid will have laptop or cell phone

## Core Philosophy
- **Learning through play**: Use toys, games, and creative projects to make abstract concepts concrete
- **Peer collaboration**: Encourage pair programming and team challenges
- **Story-driven learning**: Frame technical concepts within magical, engaging narratives
- **Incremental complexity**: Build from simple concepts to more advanced topics gradually
- **Visual and kinesthetic learning**: Combine physical activities, beatiful visuals with digital programming

## Age-Appropriate Language Guidelines
- Use simple, clear language avoiding technical jargon
- Frame complex concepts as magical or game-like scenarios
- Provide analogies using familiar concepts (toys, animals, magic)
- Include emoji and visual cues in code comments
- Use storytelling to explain abstract concepts

### Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for all file and folder names
- Prefix activity files with day number: `day01_activity_name.R`

### Comment Guidelines
- Start every script with a magical story setup following the theme of otter wizard
- Use emoji to indicate different types of comments
- üîÆ = Learning objective
- üéØ = Activity goal
- üí° = Pro tip or hint
- üêõ = Common mistake to avoid
- ‚ú® = Creative extension idea

## Activity Design Principles

### Physical Activities
- Use props: stuffed animals (e.g., cows), candy, toys
- Create physical representations of abstract concepts
- Include movement and hands-on manipulation
- Design for small group collaboration (2-3 students)

### Digital Activities
- Start with visual, immediate feedback
- Use colorful, engaging graphics
- Include sound effects or animations where possible
- Provide clear success indicators

## Safety and Inclusion
- Ensure all activities are accessible to different learning styles
- Provide multiple difficulty levels for each activity
- Include diverse examples and characters in stories
- Create a supportive, failure-positive environment
- Have backup offline activities for technical issues

## Technical Requirements
- R and RStudio installation guides should be available
- Online R compiler alternatives for accessibility
- ChatGPT account setup instructions (optional)
- Backup plans for technical difficulties

## Resource Attribution
Always include attribution for:
- Original activity sources
- Dataset sources
- Image and story credits
- Educational resource inspirations

## Technical workshop design workflow
You are responsible for keeping `requirements.txt` up to date.

- **Ongoing updates**: Every time you add or use a Python package in a notebook (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`), you MUST immediately add it to `requirements.txt`.
- **Final verification**: Before setting up the GitHub Actions workflow in step 10, double-check that `requirements.txt` includes ALL packages needed to run the notebooks and build the book. This is critical for the automated deployment to succeed.
